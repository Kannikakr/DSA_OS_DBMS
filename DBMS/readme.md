# Welcome to DBMS 

## 1. Introduction 

<b>DATA : </b> Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts like text, observations, figures, symbols,
and descriptions of things etc. It is meaningless.  


<b>Information :</b> Information is processed, organized, and structured data and enables decision making. 
 
<b>DataBase</b> : Electronic place where is data is stored. It should be stored in a just a way that data can be accessable in the effective manner. 

<b> Data Base Management System [DBMS] </b>: Database along with all software and functionality. 

Now a days DataBase and DBMS are integrated. 

### Why not file system ? 

1. Data inconsistancy and redundancy.
2. Data isolation.
3. Security problem.
4. Accessability problems.
